# Project2
This GUI is about inventory management.
In this project, I have made an inventory management GUI which can be used for adding items. It calculates the price of items by multiplying the price of each item with the no. of quantities of each item. Also you can search for certain item, remove any item. This GUI is password protected for the admin. So admin has to enter the id and password to continue.
